👋 Hi, I’m Abhinav Dahal, a recent Business Administration graduate with a specialization in International Business. My passion lies in becoming a skilled business analyst, where I can leverage data to make informed business decisions. 

👀 I’m deeply interested in learning and mastering data analysis techniques, particularly in the realm of Big Data. I'm fascinated by how data can drive strategies, uncover trends, and optimize processes in the business world.

🌱 I’m currently on a journey to enhance my technical skills, focusing on SQL and other database-related languages such as Python and R programming. I'm constantly exploring new tools and methodologies to deepen my understanding of data analysis.
